Simple Python script for downgrading audio and video quality of .mp4 files.

  

# Why?

I often see **music clips converted to poor quality**, and since I have a **very broken humor** and **it makes me laugh** - I made this simple script to **create such things**.

  

# Requirements

- [Python 3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/),

- [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html),

- At least 2 brain cells.

  

# Installation

- **Clone** the repository or **download** the **code**,

- **Install required libraries** (requirements.txt),

- Put **.mp4 videos** you want to convert to **inputs** folder,

- Run **start.bat**
